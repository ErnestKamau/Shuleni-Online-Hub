### Project Summary

Shuleni is a full-stack school management platform that brings the entire physical school experience online. It enables school owners to create and manage schools, assign students and educators to classes, upload resources, conduct assessments, and track attendanceâ€”all through a secure, role-based web interface.

This project demonstrates modern web application architecture using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. Key concepts include RESTful API design, JWT-based token authentication, CORS configuration for cross-origin requests, ORM-based data modeling with SQLAlchemy, secure password management with Bcrypt, and robust data serialization and validation with Marshmallow. The system also features file upload and static file serving, role-based access control, and database migration management, providing a scalable and maintainable foundation for digital education management.

This project exemplifies a robust, modern web application architecture by leveraging **Flask** as the backend framework and **React** for the frontend interface. The backend exposes a well-structured **RESTful API**, where each resource (such as schools, classes, users, assessments, and submissions) is mapped to a dedicated endpoint, supporting standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations. This design ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of integration with various clients.

**Authentication and authorization** are enforced using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, implemented via the `flask_jwt_extended` library. Each user receives a signed token upon login, which must be included in subsequent requests to access protected endpoints. This stateless authentication mechanism enhances security and simplifies session management across distributed systems.

To enable seamless communication between the React frontend (often running on a different port during development) and the Flask backend, **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is configured using the `flask_cors` extension. This setup allows the frontend to securely make API requests without browser-imposed cross-origin restrictions.

**Data modeling** is handled using **SQLAlchemy ORM**, which maps Python classes to relational database tables. Complex relationshipsâ€”such as many-to-many associations between students, educators, and classesâ€”are explicitly defined, reflecting real-world school structures. This abstraction simplifies database operations and ensures data integrity.

**Password security** is a priority, with all user passwords hashed using **Bcrypt** before storage. The `flask_bcrypt` extension provides strong, industry-standard hashing, protecting user credentials even in the event of a data breach.

**Data serialization and validation** are managed by **Marshmallow** and `marshmallow_sqlalchemy`. Custom schemas serialize ORM model instances into JSON for API responses and validate incoming data for correctness and completeness, reducing the risk of invalid or malicious input.

The system supports **file uploads** (such as class resources and assignments), storing them on the server and serving them via a dedicated static route. This allows students and educators to share and access documents securely and efficiently.

**Role-based access control** is implemented throughout the API, ensuring that only users with appropriate roles (e.g., owner, educator, student) can perform certain actions, such as grading assessments or managing class memberships.

**Database migrations** are managed with **Flask-Migrate**, enabling the team to evolve the database schema safely and incrementally as the application grows.

Together, these technologies and design patterns provide a secure, maintainable, and scalable foundation for digital education management, supporting real-world workflows such as onboarding, resource sharing, assessment, grading, and analytics within a modern web environment.
